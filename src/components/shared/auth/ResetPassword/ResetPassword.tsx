This component manages the password reset process. It allows users who have forgotten their
passwords to reset them by providing their registered email address. The process includes
sending a password reset link to the user's email, which they can use to create a new password.
The interface is designed to be user-friendly and secure, ensuring that users can easily
and safely regain access to their accounts.
